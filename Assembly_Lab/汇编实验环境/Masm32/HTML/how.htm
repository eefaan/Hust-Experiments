?</font></font></i></b></center>

<p><b>It is designed to plug into a computer that has other programming
environments set up on it and this places some restrictions on the format.
To avoid the problems associated with picking up the wrong link versions
and wrong library directory, MASM32 works with specified paths to all of
the binary files it needs to build the files.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the source code, the paths to the library files are specified
and in the batch files that are used by the editor to drive the build options,
the paths of each binary file is specified as well.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Files from other sources usually do not build from MASM32 without
some modification, usually placing the following MASM specific directives
at the beginning of the source file will solve most of the problems. The
other is to use the "include" &amp; "includelib" syntax for the INCLUDE
file and LIBRARIES so that their paths can be found.</b><b></b>

<p><b>MASM32 uses its own version of "windows.inc". It is a file over 800k
in size and has a very large set of equates and structures in it for 32
bit windows programming. It should always be put before the system include
files and libraries.</b><b></b>
<p><b>EXAMPLE</b><b></b>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include
\masm32\include\windows.inc&nbsp;&nbsp; ; always first</font></tt></b><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00"></font></tt></b>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include
\masm32\include\user32.inc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; system include</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include
\masm32\include\kernel32.inc&nbsp; ; file next</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include
\masm32\include\gdi32.inc</font></tt></b><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00"></font></tt></b>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; includelib
\masm32\lib\user32.lib&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; matching system</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; includelib
\masm32\lib\kernel32.lib&nbsp;&nbsp; ; libraries after that</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; includelib
\masm32\lib\gdi32.lib</font></tt></b><b></b>
<p><b>MASM32 uses a generated set of include files for the system functions
that are derived from the libraries. For each library, you use the include
file that matches it. To find a function that you need depending on the
reference material you are using, look in the system include file to see
which file has the prototype for the function and include the file and
the matching library.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Most of the common functions are in the three big system DLLs so
if you look in,</b><b></b>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GDI32.INC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; graphics related functions</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KERNEL32.INC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; operating system kernel functions</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font color="#FFCC00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USER32.INC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; various user interface &amp; other functions</font></tt></b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will find most of the common functions.</b><b></b>
<p><b>For functions that are not in the main libraries, usually the Microsoft
reference material specifies which library the function is in so if you
look in the include file for that library, you will find the prototype
for it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>There are two main reference sources for writing 32 bit assembler
in Windows, for the assembler instructions and the general architecture
of x86 series processors, the three (3) volume set of PDF files from Intel
are the best available and are exhaustively documented in the PIII manual
set.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The other is Microsoft reference material. The most common is a help
file called "WIN32.HLP" which is now a little out of date but still useful.
It is a help file of about 12 meg in size. If you have the MSDN 2 CD set,
the information is later and much larger but it also takes up about 800
meg of disk space when installed. Another alternative is the PLATFORMSDK
help files but they are also of about the same size.</b>
