<p><b><font color="#CCCCCC">The original code design used in MASM32 was
designed in conjunction with </font><font color="#FF6600">Iczelion</font><font color="#CCCCCC">
to make assembler accessible to programmers who wanted to write low level
code. </font><font color="#FF6600">Iczelion</font><font color="#CCCCCC">
has contributed his excellent set of tutorials so that programmers learning
assembler has a range of examples available to start from.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6600">Clive Turvey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was
kind enough to build a PE version of DumpPE for MASM32 which is very useful,
both in its PE header information and with its clean and simple disassembler.</font></b><b></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6600">Agner Fog</font> has given his permission to
convert his Pentium Optimisation Manual into winhelp format so that it
is available to a wider range of assembler programmers. This would be the
most comprehensive Pentium optimisation information available at the moment
and is a high quality work of considerable scholarship.</b><b></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6600">Joergen Ibsen</font> has given his permission
to include the MASM version of his aPLib compression library in the example
code for personal use. The example "aPPack" is a complete working demonstration
of its capacity.</b><b></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6600">Tim Roberts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> redesigned
some of the modules in the MASM32 library to optimise their performance
and has added a matching pair of BCD to ascii conversion modules.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6600">Ron Thomas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has
contributed an example program called "showdib" that has very useful GDI
graphic code in it.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6600">X-Calibre</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made
his "leeto" IRC program available as example code to demonstrate a very
flexible approach to MASM,&nbsp; macros and IRC generally.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#CCCCCC">Considerable support has been given by many
of the members of the EFnet IRC channel </font><tt><font size=+1><font color="#FFFF00">#win32asm</font><font color="#CCCCCC">.</font></font></tt><font color="#CCCCCC">
Ideas, testing, debugging and technical assistance in their own areas of
specialty have all added up in making MASM32 a better package for any programmer
who is interested in writing assembler.</font></b>
