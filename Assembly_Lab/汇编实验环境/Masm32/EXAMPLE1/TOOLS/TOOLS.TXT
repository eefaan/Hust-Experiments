This subdirectory contains 3 stub executable files that pass the command
line parameters to LINK.EXE for processing.

    1. LIB.EXE

    2. DUMPBIN.EXE

    3. EDITBIN.EXE

The code is identical with the exception of a single piece of BYTE data in
each, the leading part of the command line passed to LINK.EXE.

These utilities were not provided as free downloads in either the Microsoft
platformsdk or win98ddk so they have been reproduced complete with source
code so that they are available to programmers writing assembler with the
MASM32 package.
